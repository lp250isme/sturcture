Football mainly refers to English football. A wide variety, known as "The World Game".

In a standard football match, two teams each send eleven players, including ten players and a goalkeeper, to fight and attack each other on a rectangular grass pitch. Except for the goalkeeper who can touch the ball with their hands in their own penalty area, other players can only touch the ball with their body parts other than their hands (except for the throw-in). The purpose of the game is to try to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. A point is awarded for a goal, and when the game is over, the team with the most points wins. The game lasts for two equal-length halves, each of forty-five minutes, for a total of ninety minutes. If the score is the same within the specified time of the game, it depends on the rules of the game. The competition can be determined by drawing lots, play-offs (30-minute play-offs), or shooting 12-yard free throws. If it is a league, if the score is the same, a draw will be counted.

In 2004, FIFA confirmed that Cuju in ancient China was the earliest form of football. Modern football originated in England. Football is considered to be the number one sport in the world because of its wide development and great influence in the world today.
